## Machine Learning pipeline

### 1. Data loading and exploration
- Load the Fish.csv dataset using pandas
- Explore the dataset structure, missing values, and basic statistics
- Visualize data distributions and relationships

### 2. Data preprocessing
- Handle categorical variables (Species) using one-hot encoding
- Check for and handle missing values
- Scale numerical features if necessary
- Split data into training and testing sets

### 3. Model selection and training
- **Linear Regression**: For basic weight prediction
- **Polynomial Regression**: For capturing non-linear relationships
- **Random Forest**: For robust predictions with feature importance
- **KNN**: For classification tasks (species prediction)

### 4. Model evaluation
- Use appropriate metrics:
  - **Regression**: MSE, RMSE, RÂ², MAE
  - **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimation
- Feature importance analysis

### 5. Prediction and deployment
- Make predictions on new data
- Save trained models for future use
- Create prediction functions for easy use

## Usage

### Basic Linear Regression for weight prediction

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('Dataset/Fish.csv')

# Separate features and target
X = df.drop('Weight', axis=1)
y = df['Weight']

# Preprocessing
categorical_features = ['Species']
numerical_features = ['Length1', 'Length2', 'Length3', 'Height', 'Width']

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), categorical_features)
    ],
    remainder='passthrough'
)

# Apply preprocessing and split data
X_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_processed, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
print(f"R-squared Score: {r2:.3f}")
```

### Species classification using KNN

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Load data
fish = pd.read_csv('Dataset/Fish.csv')

# Features and target
X = fish.drop(['Species'], axis=1)
y = fish['Species']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42
)

# Train KNN model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, metric='minkowski', p=1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"KNN Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")

# Example prediction
sample = np.array([[340.0, 23.9, 26.5, 31.1, 12.3778, 4.6961]])
predicted_species = model.predict(sample)
print(f"Predicted species: {predicted_species[0]}")
```

### What's KNN algorithm?

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.

**Choose the Value of K**

K represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction.

The choice of K is a hyperparameter that significantly impacts performance. A smaller K can lead to overfitting (sensitive to noise), while a larger K can lead to underfitting (losing fine-grained patterns).

Odd values for K are often preferred in classification to avoid ties in majority voting.

Cross-validation can be used to find the optimal K for your specific dataset.

**Find K-Nearest Neighbors**

Sort the calculated distances in ascending order.

Select the top K data points from the sorted list, as these are the nearest neighbors.

**Prediction**

For Classification:

Determine the most frequent class among the K nearest neighbors. This class becomes the predicted label for the new data point.

For Regression:

Calculate the average (or weighted average) of the target values of the K nearest neighbors. This average becomes the predicted value for the new data point. 

## Insights

1. **Length measurements** are typically the most important features for weight prediction
2. **Species** significantly influences the weight-to-size relationship
3. **Polynomial features** can capture non-linear growth patterns in fish
4. **Cross-validation** is essential for reliable performance estimation

## Troubleshooting

### Issues

1. **ModuleNotFoundError**: Make sure your virtual environment is activated and packages are installed
2. **File not found**: Ensure you're running scripts from the project root directory
3. **Memory issues**: If dataset is large, consider using batch processing or feature selection

- Check that your virtual environment is activated: `which python` should point to your venv
- Verify package versions: `pip list`
- Ensure you're in the correct directory: `pwd` should show the project root
